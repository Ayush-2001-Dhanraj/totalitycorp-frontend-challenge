## Tech Stack ⚙️

I've employed a variety of cutting-edge technologies to bring this project to life:

- **React.js** ⚛️: Our primary frontend library for building the user interface.

- **Redux Toolkit** 🔄: For efficient state management and maintaining a predictable state container.

- **Lottie Animations** 🎉: Used for creating engaging animations for success, loading, and empty states.

- **Material-UI (MUI)** 🎨: This versatile UI framework was chosen for its ease of setup and stylish icons.

- **React-hot-Toast** 🍞: To display non-intrusive toasts for user notifications.

## Approach 🛠️

Our approach to building this Flower Delivery Website was methodical and structured:

1. **Design Exploration** 🌼: I scoured the web for design inspirations and found the Figma design mentioned above, which served as our foundational reference.

2. **Design Components** 🖼️: I opted to use Material-UI due to its simplicity and appealing icons. Additionally, I incorporated Lottie animations to enhance user experience.

3. **Repo Structure** 📂: I visualized the project's repository and application structure, including components, pages, and Redux setup.

4. **Development Initiation** 🚀: I commenced work on the project, laying the foundation and gradually adding features.

5. **Component Expansion** ➕: As required, we introduced new components to enrich the website's functionality and aesthetics.

6. **Refactoring** 🧹: I paid close attention to code quality and continuously refactored to ensure maintainability and scalability.

7. **Deployment** 🌐: Finally, we deployed the website to make it accessible to users.
