## Figma Design Reference

I drew inspiration from this Figma design for our Flower Delivery Website:
[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/K2XrTwG0JIopmHQUFiUgOl/eCommerce---Flower-Delivery-website-%7C-UI-%26-UX-%7C-Ui-kit-%7C-Template-(Community)?node-id=171%3A526&mode=dev)

## Tech Stack

I've employed a variety of cutting-edge technologies to bring this project to life:

- **React.js**: Our primary frontend library for building the user interface.

- **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient state management and maintaining a predictable state container.

- **Lottie Animations**: Used for creating engaging animations for success, loading, and empty states.

- **Material-UI (MUI)**: This versatile UI framework was chosen for its ease of setup and stylish icons.

- **React-hot-Toast**: To display non-intrusive toasts for user notifications.

## Approach

Our approach to building this Flower Delivery Website was methodical and structured:

1. **Design Exploration**: I scoured the web for design inspirations and found the Figma design mentioned above, which served as our foundational reference.

2. **Design Components**: I opted to use Material-UI due to its simplicity and appealing icons. Additionally, I incorporated Lottie animations to enhance user experience.

3. **Repo Structure**: I visualized the project's repository and application structure, including components, pages, and Redux setup.

4. **Development Initiation**: I commenced work on the project, laying the foundation and gradually adding features.

5. **Component Expansion**: As required, we introduced new components to enrich the website's functionality and aesthetics.

6. **Refactoring**: I paid close attention to code quality and continuously refactored to ensure maintainability and scalability.

7. **Deployment**: Finally, we deployed the website to make it accessible to users.
